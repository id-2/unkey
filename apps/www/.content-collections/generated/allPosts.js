      "Before starting Unkey, I worked at several companies ranging in size from 5 to 5,000 employees, and one of the biggest hurdles a company can face is how to encourage authentic communication.\n\n## What is authentic communication?\n\nAuthentic communication has been covered many times over the years, but the idea has a few core concepts:\n\n- Being able to communicate in the style that fits you\n- Being able to be your genuine self regardless of the interaction you are having\n- Being able to have a difficult conversation and not feel you are being dismissed\n- Listening to other parties to understand their point of view\n\n## How do you build this into a team?\n\nBuilding authentic communication into a team requires a lot of work and understanding, but it pays off in the long run for the health of the team and the company. Here are some steps that can help:\n\n- **Model the behavior:** Leaders in the organization or team should lead by example when communicating with others. They should practice active listening, be open to feedback, and show empathy.\n- **Create a safe environment:** The team should feel safe to express their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or retribution.\n- **Encourage feedback:** Regular feedback sessions help team members feel heard and valued. It can also provide opportunities to address any issues or misunderstandings. It also is a great place to come up with new ideas.\n- **Celebrate diversity:** Each team member brings a unique perspective and communication style. Celebrating these differences can encourage more authentic communication.\n\nWhile all of these may seem obvious when the team is smaller, ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to share their thoughts becomes harder when the team grows.\n\n## How are we attempting this at Unkey?\n\nUnkey lives on being open from the top; Andreas and I ensure everyone understands how Unkey runs, what we expect, and the company's direction. So, for our team to feel empowered to be their authentic self when communicating, we do the following:\n\n- **Updates:** Every update we send out to investors and customers is public and can be accessed by the team; I intentionally send a Slack message every month in the general channel. These updates include our current status for KPIs, the money we have spent, the money we have left, usage, and paying customers.\n- **Open communication:** We communicate in the general channel using threads to keep things tidy, whether it is an idea, direction, or potentially something we are concerned about. This allows the team to provide their feedback, concerns, or excitement.\n- **Meetings are for everyone:** Unkey only runs two meetings as a team; one is planning every Monday, and the other is demo every other Friday. These meetings are open forums and flexible; the team can provide their thoughts about what is up next for us and things they want to work on and provide input on ideas they might have. After anything is demoed, we open the floor for discussions surrounding the feature; we can talk about the code behind it and changes that might improve it, knowing that feedback is welcomed. We also ensure everyone gets time on the floor so no one is left out.\n- **Open door policies:** Andreas and I have an open door policy, albeit more of an open Slack policy, which could lead to a meeting. Our team can come to us with concerns, problems they are facing, feedback, and ideas at any point and communicate them to us however they want.\n- **Dedicated space:** Andreas meets with the developers twice a month, and I meet with them once a month. This time is for them and not for us. They can come with technical questions, business questions, vision questions, or to chat about how they are feeling.\n\nI understand that our current implementation won’t scale past 20 or 30 team members; we will tweak this to allow for authenticated communication as we keep this a core value at Unkey.",

      '## What Is an API Gateway?\n\nAn API Gateway is like a gatekeeper for your microservices. Think of it as a gatekeeper in a busy city, checking each visitor, ensuring they have the proper permissions, and guiding them to where they need to go. Similarly, an API Gateway is at the front of your microservices system, managing requests, ensuring security, and providing a single access point for users.\n\n## Why Do We Need an API Gateway?\n\n1. **Single Entry Point**: Instead of a client needing to have multiple routes to connect to a service, a gateway allows the client to make all calls to a single endpoint. The gateway takes care of routing to the appropriate service.\n2. **Authentication**: A Gateway takes care of authenticating access to the client, and to what services the client is allowed access to.\n3. **Load Balancing**: Sharing the load across multiple services prevents any single service from becoming overloaded, ensuring steady and continuous operation.\n4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Monitors the traffic, logging requests, overseeing performance, and promptly sending notifications of any irregularities.\n5. **Access**: The Gateway, crucial for managing incomming requests, inspects incoming requests and permits or denies these based on a predefined policy, maintaining server security.\n\n\n\n## Gateway Features\n\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/gateways/diagram.png" alt="gateway diagram" width="1920" height="1080"/>\n\n- **Routing**: The Gateway primary role is to determine which service is needed to manage and respond to the request. Routing incoming requests to where they need to go and sending the response back to the user.\n- **Authentication and Authorization**: Acting as a security checkpoint, the Gateway takes the tokens from users and validates them as needed. If the user\'s token is valid, the Gateway then checks what permissions are associated with that token. If the token does not match the permissions, the request is denied, ensuring that only authenticated users are allowed to proceed further into the system. If you have ever gone through an airport security checkpoint, this might sound familiar. If you do not have a first-class ticket, you are not getting into first class. Gateways can manage multiple authentication methods, which are normalized and then sent to the requested microservices.\n- **Request Transformation**: Considering the variety of programming languages used on the web, each with its own structure and syntax, Gateways play an integral role. They have the ability to transform user/client requests  into the language required by the service. This translation of client requests into a format understood by the services ensures smooth and efficient communication, regardless of the language used by the client. This capability enhances the overall performance of the system. This also allows for backwards compatibility, eliminating the need to modify other systems that might be challenging to change.\n- **Response Aggregation**: Gateways allow for accessing multiple services through a single API request. The user sends a request via the Gateway, the Gateway executes all the necessary calls required to retrieve the desired data from various services. This streamlined process not only makes the user\'s life simpler but also significantly reduces frustration, as it eliminates the need for them to make multiple API requests for different services. Instead, they can now access all the information they need through a single, efficient API request.\n- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: In order to maintain a high level of service and prevent any potential overload, the Gateway can implement rate limiting and throttling. The Gateway enforces these measures to maintain service quality and prevent overuse. These limits ensure steady resource allocation, prevent excessive usage by any user or service, and guarantee consistent performance for all users.\n- **Analytics**: Gateways offer insight into API requests. They act as a single endpoint that provides valuable data for all microservices. This is particularly useful for pinpointing heavily used APIs that might need optimization due to poor latency. This is also crucial when contemplating the deprecation of an API and needing to evaluate its present usage.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n- **Security**: The Gateway must be security first. Any breach could compromise the entire system.\n- **Performance**: A slow Gateway means delayed responses. Optimize wisely.\n- **Service Discovery**: How does the Gateway determine the location of services? Through service registries or DNS mechanisms!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, API Gateways play a significant role in the realm of microservices. They facilitate communication, enhance security, and boost performance. Serving as a single point of entry, they manage authentication, balance load, monitor traffic, and oversee resource sharing. They also have the ability to direct requests, modify requests, group responses, and limit excessive usage. This makes them an integral component of any efficient system. However, it\'s crucial to prioritize security and performance. For developers, understanding these gateways and continuously striving to improve and secure our APIs is essential.',

      "I have always been opinionated about marketing and how it doesn't work for developer tools. Similarly, I believe that 95% of companies doing developer relations are doing it wrong, and most of it comes down to the following:\n\n> I saw X company doing it, and they were successful. I did the same, and it didn't work.\n\nThe reason you see company X succeeding is that when they started doing whatever marketing strategy, the world was different. If you are a startup trying to gain traction, you look at marketing from an enterprise perspective. Let's talk about how Unkey does marketing and why it spills a little into developer relations.\n\n## TLDR\n\n### Free\n\nFor YouTube:\n\n- People won't subscribe to a business channel, so use a personal channel if you have one.\n- If you want a business channel, expect the views-to-subscriber ratio to be weird.\n- Content of any form is good content (short form, long form, live streaming)\n\nStreaming:\n\n- If you are new. Find people in the industry to stream on their channel as a guest.\n- Stream on all platforms you can (YT, Twitch) to find the platform that works for you and your potential audience.\n- Expect that streaming will produce poor results initially (discovery could be better). If you don't see any growth after 3-6 months, stop (it's not a medium that works for you)\n\nTweeting:\n\n- Tweet from your account and tag your business account.\n- Have fun on the business account (memes, GIFs, etc)\n- Tweet from the business account when you have a following of 1k but only impactful stuff.\n\n### If you have money to spend\n\n- Influencers are your friend\n- Find five \"influencers\" in the niche, and build a relationship with them, then once you have a relationship, you can work together. They should be champions of your product, not just you paying them.\n- Sponsor community projects\n- YT videos that are sponsored. The outcome is not the \"views\"; the outcome is if someone searches for you, you aren't the only person talking about it. Even people with 2k subscribers have more reach than you do, for the most part.\n\n### Product Led growth\n\nThree key places to talk to a customer\n\n- Onboarding (send an email when they sign up offering up a way to get in touch)\n- Users who are using the product consistently\n- Offboarding (Why are you leaving)\n\n## YouTube & Streaming\n\nYouTube has unlimited marketing potential; it's why influencers in 2023 are making products. Looking at the space now, you have influencers in industries you'd never have imagined 20 years ago; let's look at Logan Paul and KSI. Both have huge followings across almost all platforms, but mostly YouTube. They now both have:\n\n- Boxing careers\n- A multi-billion dollar drink company\n- Music careers\n- Alcohol brand, food brands\n\nPrime spends almost zero dollars on marketing because they have free marketing from two influences. This means they can then spend money on sponsoring massive sporting clubs or athletes to move the brand forward. Their product could be better for what it is for, but their marketing train is incredible. What does this have to do with developer tools? I hear you ask!\n\n> YouTube is free marketing with unlimited potential.\n\n### Personal Channels vs Business Channels\n\nOpen your YouTube subscriber feed; how many companies are you subscribed to? The answer is probably close to zero if not zero, and this is where the problem for a new company starts. How do you market if people don't subscribe to your channel?\n\n#### Personal Channel\n\nIf you have a personal channel, you can get back into your channel... Assuming that one falls into your niche and your audience can roll with the content from your company. If you don't have a personal channel, the next question is, \"Do you have time\"? Right now, the answer will be yes. You are a scrappy startup, and you can make time. YouTube is a garden. It needs a lot of work to be successful. If you are interested in content creation, then go for it. Otherwise, a business channel is for you, but I still believe personal channels rule.\n\n#### Business Channel\n\nSo you want a channel that only deals with X company and things related to X company? Great! Let me break down what you'd expect from having a business channel:\n\n- People aren't going to subscribe as quickly as a personal channel\n- The content needs to be focused on things people search for.\n- Build for search in an intelligent way.\n\nIf your devtool is \"API Authentication\", please don't make a \"Getting Started with API Authentication video\". Your docs already cover this. Make videos that focus on aspects of integrating your product somewhere, \"How to secure Supabase functions using X\" is something some will search for.\n\n#### Content\n\nAll content forms are suitable content forms as long as you put the effort in:\n\n- YT Shorts / TikToks\n- YT longer form (3-20 mins)\n- YT Crash courses (30+ mins)\n- Livestreaming\n\nAll of these are searchable, all of these provide reusable content, and all of them can be embedded in the future.\n\n### Streaming\n\nSo, you want to stream? Don't. Almost every company that tries streaming gives up because a streamer is an exceptional kind of person. The amount of time spent sitting in front of an audience or no audience for hours is demanding. If you decide you are up for a challenge:\n\n- Start by testing the water with people who stream and have guests.\n- A personal channel is best\n- Expect traction to be slow\n- Give up at 3-5 months if you aren't seeing growth... Your efforts are better elsewhere.\n\n## Tweeting / Social Media\n\nIs it still called tweeting? Xing? Either way, Social Media can bring in a large amount of traffic if used correctly. To put it in perspective, our launch of Unkey was a single tweet on my account which had at the time around 4,000 followers. This brought over 700 users in the first week.\n\n<Image src=\"/images/blog-images/how-to-market/tweet-example.png\" alt=\"Example launch tweet\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\n\n### Use your account\n\nYou should tweet a lot from your account and tag your startup. Why? People trust a face, not a business. They'd rather follow you as a person and interact than a company that is just a logo. The human brain is weird, but it's true.\n\n### When to use the business account\n\nUse the business account to quote, repost a tag, and have fun with it. Companies are too serious because they think that is what people want to see. Instead, we want to see the opposite:\n\n- memes\n- GIFs\n- making fun of yourself\n\nFinally, once your business account grows a following of around 1,000 people, you can start posting updates of the product... But don't stop Memeing and quote posting/retweeting.\n\n## Got Money?\n\nSo you have money? Congrats! Let me save you some money in your marketing budget because, again, traditional marketing is dead for startups.\n\n### Find your people.\n\nThe first thing you want to do is identify five people, five developers, who have opinions and also an audience. Please don't reach out to them directly. Join their communities figure out their pain points and their needs.\n\n- Join Discords\n- Read blog posts\n- Watch their videos\n- Help in the communities\n\nThis should be obvious, but when you have blinders on and want growth and results, you can't see it. Then, you will build a reputation with the communities where you wish to use your product. DO NOT SELL. IF YOU SELL, your reputation is ruined.\n\n### Work with your people\n\nOnce you are helping communities and being part of the world you are trying to help, working with your people becomes more straightforward. You have a relationship. When you make the first piece of content, it should be about the problem you are solving. We didn't have to show any code when I worked at Clerk, and we worked with Theo for the first time. The video was four minutes long. Theo didn't show any tech behind the open-source project. Theo didn't show any actual code. Theo just talked about the problem and how we solved it. Theo talked about the pain points that we had and how we solved them. Theo talked about the challenges that we had and how we solved them. Theo showed 15 seconds of the application.\n\nThis was intentional; we wanted people to see the problem and how we finally solved it, and then we wanted them to go and try it out for themselves. We didn't want to show them how to do it, we wanted them to figure it out themselves. We wanted them to see the problem and then go and try it out for themselves. I also wanted to do my video on the same topic, this time showing the tech behind it all and how it worked.\n\nThis single content piece increased our daily sign-ups and our daily active users by a magnitude of almost 10.\n\n### Double down? Triple down? Quadruple down?\n\nThe problem with most companies is that they need to double down on what's working. They need to triple down on what's working. They don't quadruple down on what's working. They keep doing the same thing over and over again, with different people, different audiences, and different target methods, hoping that it will work.\n\nDo the opposite, double down on what is working. Triple down on what is working. Quadruple down on what is working. If you find the right person, they should be hyped about your product, and you should be promoted about their success. Working together should be easy! If it's not, you are working with the wrong person.\n\n### Sponsor community projects\n\nHave you ever tuned in to some of those events that bring minimal educational value but bring massive community value? I am talking about:\n\n- Gameshows\n- Charity events\n- Hackathons\n- Community meetups\n- Swag giveaways\n\nSPONSOR THEM. If you are a developer tool, you should be sponsoring these events. You should be sponsoring the prizes, you should be sponsoring the swag, you should be sponsoring the food. You should be sponsoring the drinks. You should be sponsoring the venue. You should be sponsoring the speakers. You should be sponsoring the creators.\n\nBefore you get upset, the community needs these events. They are the lifeblood of what keeps the community together. When, as Clerk, I sponsored the:\n\n- Frontend Horse Christmas Spectacular\n- Github projects\n- Twitter Guesser game show... Which was hilarious.\n- Colby Fayock's site launch giveaways\n\nSome of those events had no real value to Clerk, but they had value to the community. Which means they had value to Clerk.\n\n### Sponsor YT videos\n\nI've talked a lot about YouTube during this blog post, but I want to make sure you are looking at YouTube in two ways as you grow:\n\n1. Increased discoverability/brand awareness\n2. Increased usage of your product\n\n### Increased discoverability/brand awareness\n\nWhen you think about the results of a video. Views aren't everything, while yes, if you manage to work with large influencers, the views will be a byproduct. You want to think about the following:\n\n- How many people are searching for your product?\n- How many people are searching for your competitor's product?\n- How many people are searching for the problem you solve?\n- How many people are talking about the problem you solve, your product, or competitors' products?\n\nThe bottom one is increased by having more videos that aren't talking about your product. If you are the only person talking about it, why would anyone trust that your product is excellent?\n\n### Increased usage of your product\n\nThis part comes with time. You will see spikes in usage as sponsor videos go out. They are following along, but retention is the key. If you see a spike in usage and then a drop-off, you must figure out why. It's more complicated when you start because the %s are out of wack, but you can still see the trends.\n\n## Product led growth\n\nProduct led growth is super significant, and I like to do the following three things:\n\n- Onboarding (send an email when they sign up offering up a way to get in touch)\n- Users who are using the product consistently\n- Offboarding (Why you leaving)\n\n### Onboarding\n\nWhen a user onboards to your product, the first thing we do is send you an email. With three key points in it:\n\n- Quickstart\n- Security\n- Discord Community\n\n<Image src=\"/images/blog-images/how-to-market/welcome-unkey.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt =\"Example onboarding email\"/>\n\nOn top of this, they can respond to the email with feedback or questions. This is a great way to get feedback from users who are just getting started.\n\n### Users who are using the product consistently\n\nWhen users use the product consistently, we send them an email asking what they are building and how we can help. This email should be handwritten and should be from a natural person. This is a great way to get feedback from users using the product and build a relationship with them.\n\n### Offboarding\n\nWhen a user offboards, we send them an email asking them why they are leaving. This email should also handwritten and should be from a real person. We can find out what was lacking, what they didn't like, and what we can do better.\n\nYou will notice everything is related to feedback and building relationships. This is the key to product-led growth.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTraditional marketing is dead from Unkey's perspective, and I hope this blog post has helped you understand how we think about marketing and developer relations.

      'Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undeniably transformed the technology landscape in the past few years. From OpenAI to Llama 2, AI has permeated every facet of our lives. Yet, as with any groundbreaking technology, developers face unique challenges when working on AI projects. This is where Unkey comes in. Unkey\'s API management platform helps developers secure, manage, and scale their APIs.\n\n## What is Unkey?\n\nUnkey is an open source API management platform, that provides a low-latency option to create, manage and revoke API Keys for your API. We offer features like:\n\n- Rate limiting per key\n- Temporary keys\n- Limited use keys\n\nUnkey also offers seamless integration with popular programming languages making it easier for developers to work in an environment they are comfortable with. Whether you are a Typescript, Python, or a Go developer you can use Unkey in minutes.\n\n## How Unkey Can Help AI Projects\n\nWhen it comes to AI project development, Unkey is a game-changer. It aids in streamlining the API development process. With our robust features, Unkey allows developers to focus on the creative aspects of AI development rather than getting bogged down with how to secure their APIs.\n\nFor instance, consider developing an application that interacts with OpenAPI, you want users to be able to use your service but you don\'t want them to be able to abuse it. If you handle this yourself you need to think about:\n\n1. How do I identify the user\n2. Implement a rate limiting system.\n3. Implement a token system to allow them to use X tokens\n4. Make sure it\'s fast.\n\nWith Unkey you can simplify this by adding in a single API call to create a user\'s API Key with both a token system and rate limiting built in. Below is an example of a cURL request that creates a key with rate limiting of 10 requests, that refill at a rate of 1 request per second. The key also has 100 total requests allowed before they can no longer access the resource.\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.createKey \\\n  --header \'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>\' \\\n  --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\\n  --data \'{\n\t"apiId":"<API_ID>",\n\t"ratelimit":{\n\t\t"type":"fast",\n\t\t"limit":10,\n\t\t"refillRate": 1,\n\t\t"refillInterval": 1000\n\t},\n\t"remaining": 100\n}\'\n```\n\nThe response includes the key itself, which you should pass on to your user and a keyId, which you can use later to update or revoke the key. Don’t worry about storing the keyId, you can always query it later from Unkey when you need it.\n\n```jsx\n{\n  "key": "prefix_5AkwpYpIHntGBpTHLqKg",\n  "keyId": "key_123"\n}\n```\n\nSo now you have an API key, but how does that help you protect your AI project? Unkey provides a verify endpoint, this endpoint can verify a request in under 40 ms and provide you with the details you need to make a business decision. For example:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey \\\n  --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\\n  --data \'{\n    "key":"THE_NEW_KEY"\n  }\'\n```\n\nThis returns the following in the body:\n\n```bash\n{\n   "valid":true,\n   "remaining":99,\n   "ratelimit":{\n      "limit":10,\n      "remaining":9,\n      "reset":1690065988700\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAs you see Unkey returns "valid": true which allows you to make an immediate business decision, if it is true let them access the resource, if it is false deny them access. On top of that, we return the total remaining requests, which you could return to your user, and finally their rate limits.\n\nEven though these examples are in cURL we have a typescript SDK and community SDKs in Go, Python, Elixir, and a Nuxt module.\n\n## How to Start Using Unkey for Your AI Projects\n\nStarting with Unkey for your AI projects is straightforward. To begin, sign up for your free Unkey account. As soon as you create your account you will be asked to create your workspace. Give it a name, and a slug. The name is shown only to you and not to your users.\n\nNext, you need to create a root API Key, this is a special API Key that allows you full read and write access to all current and future resources. It’s important to keep this API Key safe, as it allows you to create, revoke, validate, and delete API Keys. You can do this by selecting settings and then clicking the “Create New Key” button.\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/ai-post/create-root-key.png" alt="Create Root Key" width="1920" height="1080"/>\n\nThen you can create your first API which allows you to track usage as well as segment keys, the name you choose is also not visible to users.\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/ai-post/create-api.png" alt="Create API" width="1920" height="1080"/>\n\nYou are now ready to integrate Unkey into your code! If you are manually issuing keys you can do that right from our dashboard, otherwise you can start reading our [documentation](http://unkey.com/docs) and learn about everything we have to offer.',

      'Large language models are getting faster and cheaper. The below charts show progress in OpenAI\'s GPT family of models over the past\nyear:\n\n*Cost per million tokens ($)*\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/cost-per-token-2.png" alt="Chart of cost per token over time" width="1920" height="1080" />\n\n*Tokens per second*\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/tokens-per-second-2.png" alt="Chart of cost per token over time" width="1920" height="1080" />\n\nRecent releases like Meta\'s Llama 3 and Gemini Flash have pushed the cost / speed frontier further:\n\n*Below data is for May 2024*\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/models-comparison.png" alt="Chart comparing cost and speed of LLMs in May 2024" width="1920" height="1080" />\n\nAs cost and latency have decreased, more complex LLM workflows have become increasingly viable, which in turn bring their own set of challenges.\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/llm-agent-tweet.png" alt="Chart comparing cost and speed of LLMs in May 2024" width="1920" height="1080" />\n\nSince these workflows often involve multiple steps and retries, taking measures to reduce cost and latency remains helpful. One way to do\nso is via *semantic caching*.\n\n## Example use case: RAG\n\nSay that you want to build a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) chatbot for customer support. It can respond to user queries and suggest\narticles from your support center.\n\nThis workflow would involve multiple API calls:\n\n1. Generate embedding of user query\n2. Search vector DB for relevant embeddings and append to prompt\n3. Query LLM API with enhanced prompt\n\nThrough caching, you could avoid doing this work except for when users ask questions that haven\'t been asked before - otherwise, re-use\nexisting work.\n\n## Caching\n\nA simple caching solution would be to cache results using the user query as the key, and the result of the workflow as the value.\n\nThis would enable re-use of responses between identical queries. But it would rely on user queries being phrased identically.\n\nFor instance, if two users asked "How do I cancel my subscription" then the second would be served the cached response. But if another\nuser was to ask "I need to cancel my subscription - how?" then we\'d see a cache miss. The question is the same in terms of its intent,\nbut the phrasing is different.\n\nThis is how semantic caching can be useful: through caching based on the embedding of the query, we can ensure that all users who ask\nthe same question receive a cache hit. The below diagrams give an overview of the architecture:\n\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/cachehit.png" alt="Diagram showing cache hit" width="1920" height="1080" />\n<Image src="/images/blog-images/semantic-caching/cachemiss.png" alt="Diagram showing cache miss" width="1920" height="1080" />\n\n\n## Try it now\n\nIn response to feedback from our AI customers, we\'re offering semantic caching now as part of Unkey. You can enable it now through\n[signing up](https://unkey.dev/semantic-caching) and changing the baseUrl parameter of the OpenAI SDK:\n\n```\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n  baseURL: "https://<gateway>.llm.unkey.io", // change the baseUrl parameter to your gateway name\n});\n```\n\nUnkey\'s semantic caching is free, supports streaming, and comes with built-in observability and analytics. In future we will offer deeper integration with Unkey\'s API keys for enhanced security and performance.\n\nIf you\'d like to read more about how it works, check out our [documentation](https://unkey.dev/docs/semantic-caching).',
